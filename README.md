# DSA_HW01_UniqueInt_MairoPedroIsaac

## Project Description
This project implements a program that reads integers from an input file, processes them to extract unique integers, sorts them in ascending order, and writes the results to an output file. It was developed as part of the **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** course.

## Characteristics
- Read integers from a specific input file.
- Ignores non-integer and duplicate values.
- Provides unique integers sorted into a results file.
- Measures execution time for performance analysis.

## Technology Stack
- **JavaScript**: Used to write the program logic.
- **Node.js**: Execution environment to execute JavaScript code.

## How to Install
1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
2. Download or clone the project files to your local computer.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

## Usage
1. Place the input files (for example, `sample_02.txt` and `sample_04.txt`) in the `sample_inputs` directory.
2. Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   node .\code\UniqueInt.js .\sample_inputs\sample_02.txt
